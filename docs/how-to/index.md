# Deploying changes to Templates

- No-one deploys templates to production without changes, so this section presents a community discussed updates for:
-- Blueprint - adding pages and separating directories
-- Chart libraries - amChart, dash plotly, chart.js, Chartist and others - 
-- Data Integration - this library will document pandas dataframe interfaces to all charts. 
This will make your pages come alive with real data from excel, csv, sql, rest and custom-api data sources

-- Timelines - 
-- Tasks
